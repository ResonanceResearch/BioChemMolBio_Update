      <h2>Automated weekly summary</h2>
      <div style="white-space:pre-wrap;line-height:1.4">Work 1 (Viruses, 2025-08-19)
- Retraction notice issued by Viruses for the 2024 paper “Role of Protein VII in the Production of Infectious Bovine Adenovirus-3 Virion” (Kulanayake et al.); cohort author listed: Suresh K. Tikoo. 
- The retraction confirms withdrawal of the article from the journal’s record. 
- The provided data do not specify the stated reason for retraction beyond the notice.

Work 2 (Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases, 2025-08-20)
- The study reports sexual dimorphism in Borrelia burgdorferi abundance within Ixodes scapularis larvae, with higher bacterial burden in female larvae than in male larvae. 
- Findings have implications for Lyme disease transmission dynamics and vector biology. 
- Cohort author: Maarten J. Voordouw.

Work 3 (PLoS Pathogens, 2025-08-20)
- High-resolution imaging reveals heterogeneous enrichment of canonical and variant histones on individual HSV-1 genomes within the first 90 minutes of infection, highlighting genome-by-genome chromatin dynamics. 
- Daxx-dependent H3.3/H4 deposition cooperates with PML to enrich variant histone H3.3 at viral DNA and limit genome decompaction, delaying immediate-early transcription; ICP0 counters this by degrading PML to promote transcription, genome expansion, and replication. 
- A model is proposed whereby sequential histone assembly initiated by Daxx modulates early chromatinization of HSV-1 genomes and the pace of infection. 
- Cohort author: Kristen L. Conn.

Work 4 (Scientific Reports, 2025-08-21)
- A viewpoint calling for action to address critical flaws and bias in laboratory animal experiments and preclinical research, highlighting the need for improved reproducibility and transparency. 
- Emphasizes the role of systematic reforms in study design, reporting, and validation to strengthen preclinical science. 
- Cohort authors: Volker Gerdts; Andrew Potter.

          <td><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Herpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that cause a wide range of disease. Upon nuclear entry, their genomes associate with histones and chromatin modifying enzymes that regulate the progression of viral transcription and outcome of infection. While the composition and modification of viral chromatin has been extensively studied on bulk populations of infected cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation, this key regulatory process remains poorly defined at single-genome resolution. Here we use high-resolution quantitative imaging to investigate the spatial proximity of canonical and variant histones at individual Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) genomes within the first 90 minutes of infection. We identify significant population heterogeneity in the stable enrichment and spatial proximity of canonical histones (H2A, H2B, H3.1) at viral DNA (vDNA) relative to established promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear body (PML-NB) host factors that are actively recruited to viral genomes upon nuclear entry. We show the replication-independent histone H3.3/H4 chaperone Daxx to cooperate with PML to mediate the enrichment and spatial localization of variant histone H3.3 at vDNA and limit the rate of HSV-1 genome decompaction. This host response is counteracted by the viral ubiquitin ligase ICP0, which degrades PML to disperse Daxx and variant histone H3.3 from vDNA to stimulate the progression of viral immediate-early (IE) transcription, genome expansion, and onset of HSV-1 replication. Our data support a model of intermediate and sequential histone assembly initiated by Daxx that limits the rate of HSV-1 genome decompaction independently of the stable enrichment of histones H2A and H2B at vDNA required to facilitate canonical nucleosome assembly. We identify HSV-1 genome decompaction upon nuclear infection to play a key role in the initiation and functional outcome of HSV-1 lytic infection, findings pertinent to the transcriptional regulation of many nuclear replicating herpesvirus pathogens.</div></details></td>
