In 37 sepsis survivors, native T1 and synthetic ECV showed no significant correlation with LV ejection fraction, while native T2 values had only a weak correlation; the study used CMR parametric mapping (native T1/T2, post-contrast T1/ECV) to probe diffuse fibrosis and edema; the abstract truncates before giving ROC conclusions, but no strong link to LV dysfunction is reported.

Vitamin B12 deficiency in newly-arrived pregnant refugees in Calgary, Canada from 2015-2020 — medRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) (2025-08-27); Cohort author: Adam Kirton. Among 159 tested, B12 deficiency was 42.8%; iron deficiency was 50.3% and anemia 54.7%, with 58.8% of B12-deficient individuals also iron-deficient; B12 deficiency was linked to later gestational age at first prenatal visit and to hemoglobinopathy; macrocytosis was not reliably present to rule out deficiency, underscoring the need for B12 screening in this population.

Restoration of locomotor function following stimulation of the A13 region in Parkinson’s mouse models — venue not listed (2025-08-27); Cohort author: Zelma H. T. Kiss. Photoactivation of the A13 region alleviates bradykinesia/akinesia and increases turning in a PD mouse model, indicating pro-locomotor effects; the A13 region projects to the mesencephalic locomotor region and shows widespread remodeling of afferent/efferent projections, supporting the zona incerta as a rapid motor-control hub and a potential therapeutic target for PD gait dysfunction; publication venue not specified in the provided data.

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Background/Objectives: Survivors of sepsis can develop left ventricular (LV) systolic function with focal myocardial fibrosis. The relationship between diffuse myocardial fibrosis or oedema and LV systolic function remains unknown in this patient cohort. This study sought to address this knowledge gap using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) parametric mapping methods. Methods: Sepsis survivors who underwent CMR at a UK cardiac centre were included. CMR images analysed include cines, native T1-mapping, native T2-mapping, and post-contrast T1-mapping. Synthetic extracellular volume (ECV) fraction was also estimated. Native myocardial T1 values, native myocardial T2 values, and ECV values were compared against LV ejection fraction (LVEF). Results: Of the 37 sepsis survivors (age 53 ± 16 years old; 57% males), the mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 55% (IQR 43–62), and 43% of the patients had LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF &amp;lt; 50%). Mean native myocardial T1 values were 1055 ± 65 ms (septal) and 1051 ± 60 ms (global). Mean synthetic ECV values were 0.30 ± 0.04. Mean native myocardial T2 values were 52 ± 7 ms (septal) and 53 ± 6 ms (global). Septal and global native myocardial T1 values were not significantly correlated with LVEF (rho = 0.080, p = 0.637; rho = 0.036, p = 0.831, respectively). Synthetic ECV was not significantly correlated to LVEF (rho = −0.082; p = 0.723). Septal and global native myocardial T2 values were weakly correlated with LVEF (rho = 0.261, p = 0.281; rho = 0.216, p = 0.375, respectively). On ROC analysis, the performance of native myocardial T1 values, ECV, and native myocardial T2 values for predicting LV dysfunction was modest (AUC: 0.53 ± 0.10, 0.54 ± 11, and 0.68 ± 0.14; all p &amp;gt; 0.05, respectively). Conclusions: CMR markers of diffuse myocardial fibrosis (native T1-mapping and ECV) and myocardial oedema (native T2-mapping) have weak relationships with left ventricular systolic function in this study cohort of sepsis survivors. Further work is needed to better assess the role of diffuse myocardial fibrosis and oedema in the pathophysiology of post-sepsis cardiomyopathy.</div></details></td>

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Background Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to adverse maternal and infant outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight. Pregnant refugees are particularly vulnerable to nutritional deficiencies due to food insecurity and gastrointestinal conditions. However, limited research has explored the prevalence of B12 deficiency among pregnant refugees in Canada. Objective To determine the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in pregnant refugees receiving care at the Mosaic Refugee Health Clinic (MRHC) in Calgary and to examine their demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review for pregnant patients at MRHC with estimated delivery dates between November 2015 to December 2020. We assessed the association between B12 deficiency and demographic characteristics, anemia, iron deficiency, macrocytosis, and relevant infectious diseases using chi-square tests and Fisher&#x27;s exact tests. Results Of 159 pregnant refugee patients tested for B12, 42.8% (n=68) had B12 deficiency (&amp;lt;220 pmol/L), 50.3% (n=80) had iron deficiency (ferritin &amp;lt;30 ul/L), 54.7% (n=87) were anemic (hemoglobin &amp;lt;110 g/L), and &amp;lt;5 had macrocytosis. Among patients with B12 deficiency, 58.8% (n=40) had concomitant iron deficiency. B12 deficiency was significantly associated with later gestational age at first prenatal visit (p=0.034). There was an association between B12 status and hemoglobinopathy (p=0.027), but it was not in the expected direction. No significant associations were found with other demographic or clinical characteristics (p&amp;gt; 0.050). Conclusion B12 and iron deficiency were common among newly arrived pregnant refugees, suggesting poor nutritional status. The absence of macrocytosis was insufficient to rule out B12 deficiency. Screening for B12 deficiency during pregnancy, while not recommended in Canada, may be considered for refugees.</div></details></td>

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by extensive motor and non-motor dysfunction, including gait disturbance, which is difficult to treat effectively. This study explores the therapeutic potential of targeting the A13 region, a heterogeneous region of the medial zona incerta (mZI) containing dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons that has shown relative preservation in PD models. The A13 is identified to project to the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), with a subpopulation of cells displaying activity correlating to movement speed, suggesting its role in locomotion. We show that photoactivation of this A13 region can alleviate bradykinesia and akinetic features, while increasing turning in a mouse model of PD. These effects combine disease-specific rescue of function with a possible gain of function. We identified areas of preservation and plasticity within the A13 region using whole-brain imaging. Our findings suggest a global remodeling of afferent and efferent projections of the A13 region, highlighting the zona incerta’s role as a crucial hub for the rapid selection of motor function. The study unveils the significant pro-locomotor effects of the A13 region and suggests its promising potential as a therapeutic target for PD-related gait dysfunction.</div></details></td>
