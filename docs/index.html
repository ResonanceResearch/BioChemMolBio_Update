          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">ABSTRACT Traumatic bone marrow lesions (BMLs) occur in ~80% of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, typically in the lateral femoral condyle (LFC) and lateral tibial plateau (LTP). Associated with microfractures, vascular proliferation, inflammation, and bone density changes, BMLs may contribute to posttraumatic osteoarthritis. However, their relationship with knee pain is unclear. This study examined the prevalence, characteristics, and progression of BMLs after ACL injury, focusing on associations with pain, meniscal and ligament injuries, and fractures. Participants ( N = 100, aged 14–55) with MRI‐confirmed ACL tears were scanned within 6 weeks post‐injury (mean = 30.0, SD = 9.6 days). BML volumes were quantified using a validated machine learning method, and pain assessed via the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Analyses included t ‐tests, Mann–Whitney U, chi‐square, and Spearman correlations with false discovery rate correction. BMLs were present in 95% of participants, primarily in the LFC and LTP. Males had 33% greater volumes than females ( p &amp;lt; 0.05), even after adjusting for BMI. Volumes were higher in cases with depression fractures ( p = 0.022) and negatively associated with baseline KOOS Symptoms. At 1 year, 92.68% of lesions (based on lesion counts) resolved in Nonsurgical participants, with a 96.13% volume reduction ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). KOOS outcomes were similar between groups, except for slightly better Pain scores in the Nonsurgical group. Baseline Pain and Sport scores predicted follow‐up outcomes. BMLs are common post‐ACL injury, vary by sex and fracture status, and modestly relate to early symptoms. Most resolve within a year, with limited long‐term differences by surgical status.</div></details></td>

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures indicative of white matter integrity have consistently been shown to be altered in the state of the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, diffusion MRI acquisitions are not routinely collected as part of the standard medical imaging of ALS patients. T1-weighted MRI scans are commonly available in the clinical assessment of most ALS patients. While visual inspection of these scans reveals little about the cerebral pathology of ALS, analysis of their textural patterns has identified disease-related abnormalities in patients at various stages of the disease. The present study aimed to examine the spatial and temporal profile of corticospinal tract and corpus callosum degeneration in ALS patients using texture analysis of T1-weighted MRI scans obtained at baseline and at four-and eight-month follow-ups. The study involved data from 64 ALS patients and 83 healthy controls who participated in the multicenter Canadian ALS Neuroimaging Consortium (CALSNIC) project. The texture feature &quot;autocorrelation&quot; was quantified along the superior-inferior course of the corticospinal tract and along the anterior-posterior direction of the corpus callosum of participants. Progressive textural changes were observed within the bilateral corticospinal tract, particularly in the primary motor cortex region, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and the cerebral peduncle. As the disease progressed, significant textural changes developed in the middle and anterior parts of the corpus callosum. Autocorrelation values in these regions correlated with the degree of upper motor neuron dysfunction on neurological examination. Progressive corticospinal tract and corpus callosum degeneration was characterized in ALS using a novel imaging texture analysis approach, with changes observed over an interval of 4 months. ALS＝ Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; CST＝ corticospinal tract; CC = corpus callosum; ALSFRS-R= ALS functional rating scale-revised; CALSNIC = Canadian ALS Neuroimaging Consortium; DPR = disease progression rate; ECAS = Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen; HC = healthy control; FDR = false discovery rate; UMN = upper motor neurons.</div></details></td>

Risk estimates that appropriately account for uncertainty and quantitative star ratings were generated to assess the strength of evidence. Our analysis revealed that even small deviations from optimal hemoglobin levels—particularly on the low end (i.e., anemia)—are associated with non-linear increased risks of all-cause maternal and neonatal mortality, postpartum hemorrhage, maternal sepsis, preterm birth, low birthweight, and large-for-gestational-age. Across outcomes, maternal hemoglobin levels associated with the lowest risk ranged from 109–135 g/L, challenging the appropriateness of fixed anemia thresholds. Even modest population-level shifts in hemoglobin distributions could meaningfully affect the burden of adverse outcomes, implicitly supporting development of more refined, trimester- and outcome-specific clinical thresholds to better identify at-risk individuals and guide evidence-based maternal health policy. Evidence strength ratings further clarify which associations are robust and which require further research.</div></details></td>

Evidence of reproducibility of simultaneous measurement of GABA and GSH using Hadamard-encoded spectral editing (i.e., HERMES) in challenging brain regions for MRS, such as the mesial temporal lobe (MTL), is needed. Goal(s): Determine the reproducibility of HERMES-sLASER in the MTL. Approach: Two MTL HERMES scans were acquired in 15 participants, with participants repositioned between scans. Results: The average CV for GABA+ was 14.09% and the average CV for GSH was 18.94%, comparable to previous work investigating these metabolites in the MTL using standalone acquisitions. Impact: This study quantifies the reproducibility of HERMES-sLASER in the challenging region of the mesial temporal lobe. These results show that this technique can be used to measure multiple metabolites by editing them simultaneously and provides guidance on expected effect sizes.</div></details></td>

Goal(s): Our goal was to identify multimodal brain patterns that predict longitudinal behavioural and mental health measures. Approach: Linked variations of cortical structure and white matter microstructure were assessed for relationships with longitudinal clinical measures. Results: Together, macro and microstructural features within emotion regulation regions reliably predicted longitudinal symptoms of anxiety and depression. Deep gray matter volume and projection fibre microstructure predicted behavioural inhibition and sensation seeking in males, with differences between pairs of twins with and without self-injurious behaviour. Impact: Our results demonstrate reliable brain patterns in childhood that predict primarily sub-clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression in a population-based sample. These findings motivate early supports and interventions for children identified at-risk of poor mental health trajectories.</div></details></td>

Goal(s): Determine if post-valvular kinetic energy (KE) and viscous energy loss (EL) can quantify LV load associated with BAV lesions. Approach: Four-dimensional cardiovascular magnetic resonance flow imaging data employed to calculate KE and EL in BAVs with different isolated lesion types. Results: Elevated KE was observed in both regurgitation and stenosis, with notable correlations to LV functional and structural metrics, underscoring KE&#x27;s potential as a predictor of LV workload.

HBHB Hydrolysis however produces BHB and 1,3-butanediol, which share prominent spectral signatures complicating metabolite quantification. Goal(s): Investigate feasibility and robustly detection of BHB. Subsequently, investigate brain ketone-body metabolism in alcohol use disorder (AUD). Approach: HBHB was administered orally, and brain metabolism was monitored over 90 minutes using MRS with 1,3-butanediol included as a reference spectrum. Results: Combined BHB and the co-edited 1,3-butanediol were robustly detected, though separate quantification of BHB and 1,3-butanediol was challenging due to low concentrations. Impact: Accurate BHB quantification is critical to evaluate BHB transport into the brain post-keto-ester consumption. A modified J-difference editing strategy is expected to mitigate shortcomings to investigate BHB transport to assess disease severity and gain insights related to craving in AUD.</div></details></td>

MRI is crucial for monitoring MS, but conventional methods struggle to evaluate damage in normal-appearing gray and white matter (NAGM, NAWM). Goal(s): To validate non-invasive MRI metrics as biomarkers for cerebral cortex (NAGM) pathology in MS, using the EAE mouse model. Approach: We applied non-invasive ASL-MRI, multi-gradient echo, and multi-slice multi-echo sequences on a 9.4T MRI, to assess CBF, R2*, and qT2 as markers for hypoperfusion, hypoxia and inflammation. Results: EAE showed reduced CBF, increased R2* and reduced qT2. Impact: Developing non-invasive MRI metrics as biomarkers of hypoxia, hypoperfusion and disease severity in the EAE NAGM is critical to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms driving MS progression and potentially improve treatment strategies.</div></details></td>

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">ABSTRACT Purpose Motivated by the need to improve GABA-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) quality, we developed a three-module framework to improve transient averaging based on quality. We hypothesized that training a deep learning (DL) to differentiate spectrum quality could improve transient averaging compared to traditional averaging. Methods The transient averaging framework was approached through three modules: (1) a continuous-valued automated quality labeling algorithm using both traditional and recently developed MRS quality metrics, (2) a dual-domain (time and frequency) DL model that learns from these quality labels to assess quality scores for new data, and (3) a transient weighting algorithm informed by DL quality scores. The labeling algorithm was used to produce quality labels focused on retaining GABA peak shape in difference spectra (1) to train the DL model (2). The DL model quality scores were used to assign weights (3) for transient pairs within the final average difference spectrum. Results were compared to an existing software weighting algorithm for transient averaging and traditional transient averaging. Results Retaining only GABA-edited transient pairs with quality labels above zero, defined by metrics evaluating peak shapes, resulted in overall better traditional and recently developed mean metric values as well as better visual assessment of GABA and Glx peaks. Applying the trained DL model to in vivo scans, the average difference spectra calculated from the DL quality scores and weighting algorithm resulted in lower fit errors than averaging all transients with equal weights. Conclusion The proposed framework can optimize transient averaging based on quality for edited-MRS.</div></details></td>

Goal(s): Previous reports suggest that the abnormally enlarged transverse pontine fibers (TPF) compress the CST where they cross, causing their developmental impairment. Approach: To test this hypothesis, advanced techniques that combine diffusion and magnetization transfer imaging were used to glean tract-specific microstructural properties. Results: Results indicate lower fiber density and axon caliber in the CST compared to controls, but relatively unaffected TPF, suggesting that geometry and crossing fibers could have driven the DTI-based previous hypothesis. Impact: Our results obtained through advanced MR techniques are in contrast with the previous hypothesis that the TPF &#x27;squeeze&#x27; the CST in ARSACS, thus causing their abnormal development.

Therefore, it would be highly beneficial to have a tool to extract Heart Rate Variation (HRV) waveforms directly from fMRI data without the need for peripheral recording devices. Goal(s): Develop a machine learning framework to accurately reconstruct HRV tailored for pediatric applications.

Goal(s): To explore if long-term motor network reorganization, outside of the targeted nucleus, occurs after MRgFUS thalamotomy in essential tremor. Approach: Dentate nucleus connectivity changes in 25 essential tremor patients were tracked via fMRI at three intervals: pre-operation, one day post-operation, and twelve months post-MRgFUS. Results: Initially, the right DN showed diminished local connectivity. By one year, both DNs showed enhanced connectivity with right sensorimotor cortex (contralateral to the targeted motor network), compared to pre-MRgFUS thalamotomy. Impact: MRgFUS thalamotomy for essential tremor induces lasting motor network reorganization, suggesting that long-term tremor relief may arise from adaptive connectivity changes. These findings could inform strategies to enhance neuromodulatory treatments for essential tremor or movement disorders.</div></details></td>

Goal(s): To investigate the nature and relationship of subtle structural changes in depression-related brain areas in MS using phase congruency texture analysis. Approach: Sum of phase congruency (sPC) and weighted mean phase (WMP) were calculated in the thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala. These measures alongside lesion volumes were assessed as regressors of Beck&#x27;s Depression Inventory scores in MS. Results: FLAIR sPC and T2 WMP were compromised in MS. The thalamic sPC in FLAIR and sPC in T2 explained the greatest variance in BDI. Impact: Non-invasive measurement of subtle structural changes in depression-relevant brain gray matter may be invaluable for improving our understanding of the underlying mechanisms in people with comorbid MS and depression, encouraging further investigations of MRI phase congruency analyses.</div></details></td>

Goal(s): To determine if the vascular-protective drug eplerenone can restore cerebral blood flow in the EAE mouse model of MS. Approach: EAE was induced in mice receiving either 50mg/kg or 100mg/kg eplerenone. Cerebral blood flow was measured using continuous arterial spin labeling MRI at 9.4T. Results: High dose eplerenone (100mg/kg) prevented reduction in cortical cerebral blood flow and improved clinical scores, while the lower dose showed no effects. Impact: These findings suggest early treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists could prevent vascular dysfunction in MS patients, potentially avoiding cortical hypoxia. This introduces a new therapeutic approach targeting blood flow regulation rather than traditional immunomodulation strategies.</div></details></td>

Goal(s): We aimed to test whether associations between prenatal stress and infant temperament were mediated by altered brain connectivity. Approach: Diffusion and resting-state functional MRI scans were collected on 3-month old infants from a prospective longitudinal pregnancy-birth cohort. Results: Prenatal maternal objective stress was associated with infant negative affectivity at 6 months of age, and was mediated by decreased functional connetivity between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex at 3 months of age. Impact: Our study suggests a possible neural biomarker for predicting early atypical infant temperament caused by prenatal stress exposure. This helps understand the mechanisms via which prenatal stress can impact child development and points to potential intervention targets.</div></details></td>

Then we use a tissue-wise z-score approach to derive person-specific contrasts including lesions using the other sequences of the scan. Results: 45 individuals appear to be sufficient for constructing robust templates of the sequences. Further customization allows to create personalized sequences equivalent to the ground truth.

This risk must be carefully weighed against the potential for a SARD flare. The objective of this study was to develop a living guideline that will provide up-to-date guidance on the management of baseline immunosuppression for preexisting SARDs when initiating cancer immunotherapy with ICIs. The Canadian Research Group of Rheumatology in Immuno-Oncology (CanRIO) formed a multidisciplinary panel composed of rheumatologists, oncologists, researchers, and a patient representative, with methodological support from the Canadian Rheumatology Association (CRA). We completed a systematic literature review to inform this first installment of our living guideline. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, the panel developed recommendations for the management of baseline immunosuppression in individuals with preexisting SARDs. We identified 67 publications that reported on immunosuppression and cancer outcomes by specific preexisting rheumatic diseases, including 36 on preexisting SARD. Eight best practice statements were developed, highlighting the importance of shared decision making between patients and their care team and careful consideration of risk of SARD flare, risk of organ- or life-threatening manifestations, and potential effect of immunosuppression on cancer outcomes. Seven specific recommendations were made, 1 each for preexisting systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, Sjögren disease, myositis, sarcoidosis, vasculitis, and Behçet disease, considering both the available evidence and expert consensus. The general recommendation for preexisting SARDs was to continue baseline immunosuppression, particularly if there are organ- or life-threatening manifestations. This living guideline will provide contemporary baseline immunosuppression recommendations for individuals with cancer and preexisting SARDs when initiating ICI therapy. New recommendations will be added over time and updated, with the latest recommendations, evidence summaries, and Evidence to Decision summaries available through the CRA and CanRIO websites (www.rheum.ca, www.canrio.ca).
