It was observed that higher speeds increased the available push-off to attain greater step-up e.g., a walker at 1.4 m/s could manage a step-up amplitude of ∆h = 0.106 m with a push-off only. Step-up amplitude also required a minimum walking speed for the required push-off. When post step transition energy compensation was necessary, delayed push-off exerted along the trailing leg led to some wasted work. Walking over smooth surfaces, the delayed push-off cost was up to 7.5 times higher than the optimal push-off, whereas hip-driven compensation was lower at 3.2 times the optimal work. A similar pattern was also observed for step-ups. Our simulation results match young adult walking when terrain view was unrestricted. We utilized available empirical data to quantify the incremental energetic cost of disrupted push-off. It showed that the frequency and post step transition compensation costs were comparable. As step length further decreased, the cost of post step transition compensation rose more rapidly, possibly defining a lower limit for step length. The post step transition compensation rose by 0.18 W/kg/%∆Hz in young adults and 0.2 W/kg/%∆Hz in older adults. Additionally, visual constraints amplified the cost by 0.05 W/kg/%∆Hz.",

      "abstract_text": "A plant-focused, healthy dietary pattern, such as the Mediterranean diet enriched with dietary fiber, polyphenols, and polyunsaturated fats, is well known to positively influence the gut microbiota. Conversely, a processed diet high in saturated fats and sugars negatively impacts gut diversity, potentially leading to weight gain, insulin resistance, and chronic, low-grade inflammation. Despite this understanding, the mechanisms by which the Mediterranean diet impacts the gut microbiota and its associated health benefits remain unclear. This retrospective, observational study explored the relationships between Mediterranean dietary components-vegetables, fruits and nuts, legumes, whole grains, fish, meat, dairy, alcohol, saturated and unsaturated fats-and the gut microbiota in middle-aged adults enrolled in Alberta's Tomorrow Project, Canada. Diet was recorded using the Canadian Dietary History Questionnaire (CDHQ-II) and participants were classified into four quartiles based on a modified Mediterranean Diet Score. Blood and fecal samples were collected for metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing, respectively. Findings revealed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with increased alpha diversity and a greater abundance of beneficial fiber-degrading bacteria, including Prevotella, Parabacteroides, Clostridium XIVb, Coprobacter, and Turicibacter. Furthermore, participants who consumed more Mediterranean diet components exhibited higher concentrations of serum microbial metabolites including p-hydroxy hippuric acid and indole-acetaldehyde. Results demonstrate a pivotal role of the gut microbiota, via its metabolites in harnessing the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, highlighting its potential to promote metabolic health and prevent chronic disease.",

We sought to determine if severe fatigue in SSc patients with early disease (&amp;lt; 7 years) is associated with increased disability, inflammation and fibrosis. Methods In this exploratory cross-sectional study, 51 SSc patients were recruited locally (UofA cohort). Disability, disease damage accrual, inflammatory markers and, indicators of fibrotic and vascular complications (e.g. lung function, nailfold capillaroscopy) were compared between patients with and without severe fatigue. Fatigue was assessed using validated questionnaires (e.g. FACIT, MFI) and ME/CFS criteria. Findings were further corroborated in the national CSRG (Canadian Scleroderma Research Group) SSc cohort (n=126). Results SSc patients with severe fatigue had significantly increased disability, reduced lung function capacity, and elevated Galectin-9 levels when compared to patients without fatigue. Galectin-9 levels correlated with reduced pulmonary function, and increased disease damage accrual. Further analysis in the UofA cohort suggested that indictors associated with disease progression such as reduced nailfold capillary density, and elevated VEGF, LTα and IL-16 were present in severely fatigued patients. Discussion Severe fatigue in SSc patients is associated with increased disability, reduced pulmonary function and increased vascular remodeling. We propose that ME/CFS-like symptoms in patients with SSc may be indicative of sub-clinical inflammation and fibrosis. Further studies are required to determine whether Gal-9,may be a useful tool for the stratification of SSc patients - particularly those with severe fatigue resembling ME/CFS.",

Methods Adults undergoing IA embolization with the SMART Coil System (Penumbra, Inc.) comprising &gt; 75% of implanted coils and WAVE as the final finishing coil were enrolled at 43 global centers. Primary outcomes were adequate occlusion (Raymond–Roy Occlusion Classification, RROC I/II) at 1 year, serious adverse events (SAEs) within 24 hours, and device-related SAEs up to 7 days (or discharge). Results A total of 572 patients (mean age 59.5 years, 72.6% female) were enrolled between November 2019 and August 2022. Among target IAs, 39.9% were ruptured, 78.7% saccular, 54.1% wide-necked, and 11.2% previously treated, with 37.1% located in the internal carotid artery and 30.6% in the anterior cerebral artery. The mean size was 6.6±3.45 mm. Unassisted coiling was used in 50.7% of cases. Adjunctive therapy included stent-assisted coiling (28.8%), balloon-assisted coiling (17.7%), and flow diverters or medications (5.6%). The mean packing density was 34%. RROC I/II was 87.4% immediately post-procedure and 92.4% at 1 year. The retreatment rate was 9.8%, and recanalization was 12.7% at 1 year. SAEs rate within 24 hours was 9.3%. Device-related SAEs occurred in 1.1% of patients. The rate of major ipsilateral stroke was 1.7%. Conclusion Penumbra’s WAVE coils resulted in high packing density and effective and durable embolization of IAs in a diverse, real-world population, supporting coiling as the standard of care for IA treatment.

      "abstract_text": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition marked by persistent inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Despite its considerable global prevalence, key gaps remain in our understanding of the structural and molecular changes underlying ADHD which complicate adult diagnosis, as symptoms present differently from those observed during childhood ADHD. On the other hand, while psychostimulants effectively mitigate some symptoms, significant controversy surrounds their long-term effects on cognition, learning, and memory, and day-to-day living. Moreover, our understanding of how various medications given to alleviate ADHD symptoms during pregnancy impact the developing fetal brain also remains largely unexplored. Here, we discuss the subtle differences between ADHD in children and adults and how these symptoms alter brain development and maturation. We further examine changes in monoamine signaling in ADHD and how psychostimulant and non-pharmacological treatments modulate these neural networks. We evaluate and discuss findings as they pertain to the long-term use of ADHD medications, including in utero exposure, on cognitive outcomes, and contextualize these findings with mechanistic insights from animal models.",
