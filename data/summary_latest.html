      <div style="white-space:pre-wrap;line-height:1.4">Weight-Bearing Computed Tomography Analysis of Scapholunate Ligament Injury. PubMed. 2025-09-13. Cohort authors: Koren E. Roach; Sarah L. Manske. Introduces weight-bearing computed tomography as a novel modality to assess scapholunate ligament injuries under physiological load. Demonstrates feasibility and potential diagnostic advantages of WBCT for scapholunate instability compared with non-weight-bearing imaging. Lays groundwork for quantitative metrics and standardized criteria in this context.

The effects of contextual bias on face recognition decisions. Journal of Forensic Sciences. 2025-09-09. Cohort author: G. Bruce Pike. Shows contextual bias can sway forensic face recognition judgments, with a positive bias increasing accuracy and confidence and reducing decision times when the target is present. Uses a 3 (Bias) × 2 (Evidence strength) × 2 (Target presence) mixed design to test interactions. Finds that Cambridge Face Memory Test+ measured face recognition ability did not modulate bias effects.

Design of museum environment control and interactive visual communication based on infrared sensing and artificial intelligence behavior monitoring. International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management. 2025-09-08. Cohort author: Li Chu. Proposes an infrared sensing–driven framework for museum environment control and interactive visual communication aided by AI-based behavior monitoring. Integrates real-time sensing with AI to optimize environmental conditions and enrich visitor engagement. Outlines a deployable system architecture and assurance considerations for cultural institutions.

An experimental study of eccentrically loaded slender concrete masonry walls at full- and half-scale. Engineering Structures. 2025-09-08. Cohort author: Nigel G. Shrive. Reports experimental tests on slender concrete masonry walls subjected to eccentric loading at full and half scale. Examines load-bearing behavior and observed failure modes to illuminate scale effects and guide design. Provides data for validation of analytical and numerical models of slender CMU wall behavior.

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Contemporary research has demonstrated the effects of bias on, even expert, forensic decision making. The paper aimed to test if forensically relevant face recognition decisions could be influenced by biasing information. A 3 (Bias (within-subjects): positive bias vs. negative bias vs. control) × 2 (evidence strength (between-subjects): weak video evidence (N = 97) vs. strong video evidence (N = 98)) × 2 (target presence (within-subjects): absent vs. present) mixed-design was utilized. Confidence, accuracy, and decision time were measured. In total, 195 participants were recruited. The Cambridge face memory test+ was used to measure face recognition ability. Participants saw 36 videos emulating Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage of a person walking down the corridor. Participants were randomly allocated to either the strong or weak evidence condition. Participants were shown a statement for each video that contained either a positive bias (target face matched the face in the video), a negative bias (target face did not match the face in the video), or control (no statement provided). Participants were then presented with a target face and asked if it matched the face seen in the previous video. There was a significant interaction between the bias and the target presence factors, with accuracy and confidence increasing and decision times decreasing when a positive bias statement was used when the target was present. Face recognition abilities did not act as a covariate. Bias may influence facial recognition decisions, and superior face recognition abilities do not undermine the influence of bias. Recommendations/implications, such as linear sequential unmasking, were discussed.</div></details></td>
