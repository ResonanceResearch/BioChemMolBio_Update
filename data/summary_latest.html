      <div style="white-space:pre-wrap;line-height:1.4">1) A call to action to address critical flaws and bias in laboratory animal experiments and preclinical research — Scientific Reports — 2025-08-21 — Cohort authors: Volker Gerdts; Andrew Potter — Raises concerns about bias in lab animal experiments and preclinical research; advocates reforms to experimental design, reporting, and oversight; calls for actionable steps to improve reproducibility and translational value.

2) Sexual dimorphism of the Lyme disease bacterium in its tick vector – Abundance of Borrelia burgdorferi is higher in female than male Ixodes scapularis larvae — Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases — 2025-08-20 — Cohort author: Maarten J. Voordouw — Borrelia burgdorferi loads are higher in female Ixodes scapularis larvae than in males; highlights sex-based differences in pathogen abundance with potential implications for transmission; informs models of Lyme disease risk and tick biology.

3) Daxx mediated histone H3.3 deposition on HSV-1 DNA restricts genome decompaction and the progression of immediate-early transcription — PLoS Pathogens — 2025-08-20 — Cohort author: Kristen L. Conn — Daxx-mediated H3.3 deposition on HSV-1 DNA restricts genome decompaction and IE transcription; Daxx cooperates with PML to enrich H3.3 at vDNA while ICP0 counteracts by degrading PML to promote transcription and replication; proposes a sequential histone assembly model initiated by Daxx that limits genome decompaction.

4) RETRACTED: Kulanayake et al. Role of Protein VII in the Production of Infectious Bovine Adenovirus-3 Virion — Viruses — 2025-08-19 — Cohort author: Suresh K. Tikoo — Retraction notice issued for the 2024 Viruses article on Protein VII in Bovine Adenovirus-3; the article’s findings are officially withdrawn from the literature; the retraction is noted in the record.

By the numbers:
Scientific Reports 1; Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases 1; PLoS Pathogens 1; Viruses 1 (retraction); Total works 4.</div>

          <td><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Herpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that cause a wide range of disease. Upon nuclear entry, their genomes associate with histones and chromatin modifying enzymes that regulate the progression of viral transcription and outcome of infection. While the composition and modification of viral chromatin has been extensively studied on bulk populations of infected cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation, this key regulatory process remains poorly defined at single-genome resolution. Here we use high-resolution quantitative imaging to investigate the spatial proximity of canonical and variant histones at individual Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) genomes within the first 90 minutes of infection. We identify significant population heterogeneity in the stable enrichment and spatial proximity of canonical histones (H2A, H2B, H3.1) at viral DNA (vDNA) relative to established promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear body (PML-NB) host factors that are actively recruited to viral genomes upon nuclear entry. We show the replication-independent histone H3.3/H4 chaperone Daxx to cooperate with PML to mediate the enrichment and spatial localization of variant histone H3.3 at vDNA and limit the rate of HSV-1 genome decompaction. This host response is counteracted by the viral ubiquitin ligase ICP0, which degrades PML to disperse Daxx and variant histone H3.3 from vDNA to stimulate the progression of viral immediate-early (IE) transcription, genome expansion, and onset of HSV-1 replication. Our data support a model of intermediate and sequential histone assembly initiated by Daxx that limits the rate of HSV-1 genome decompaction independently of the stable enrichment of histones H2A and H2B at vDNA required to facilitate canonical nucleosome assembly. We identify HSV-1 genome decompaction upon nuclear infection to play a key role in the initiation and functional outcome of HSV-1 lytic infection, findings pertinent to the transcriptional regulation of many nuclear replicating herpesvirus pathogens.</div></details></td>
